### About ArboretumID
- ArboretumIdentifier (ArboretumID) is an app that enhances the Penn State Arboretum experience through AR and ML. 
- Using the iPhoneâ€™s camera, ArborIdentifier scans the placard in front of any plant, and delivers rich details and descriptions about it. 
- ArboretumID provides Penn State students, alumni, and visitors of any age the opportunity to explore the incredible collections of plants, flowers, and trees at the Penn State Arboretum in a whole new way!

### Features
1. Home Tab: 
- Describes The Arboretum at Penn State and its Collections
- Introduces ArborID application

2. Explore Tab: 
- Uses data from PlantFinder for Plant Attributes to build out Collections
    - Remotely loads images for plants, and provides an 'Image Coming Soon' for plants that do not yet have images available.
- Shows all 11 Collections with Images at The Arboretum
- Each Collection has Plants with Images
- Each Plant has a DetailView showing Image, Name, Location, Taxon Name,  Family, Genus

3. Capture Tab:
- Uses CoreML pre-trained model to detect and label plants as one of 5 types:
    - Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, Tulip
- Provides users with 3 Capture Options:
    - Photo Library, Photo Capture, Live Preview
- Each capture option will return its prediction of what label to assign to an image, and its confidence percentage
- In the future, more training data and labels can be added to the model to expand its capabilities

4. Around Me Tab:
- Provides a SwiftUI Map view of the Arboretum, with annotations on where plants are
- Displayed annotations can be filtered by Collection
- User Location Tracking is possible, but is currently disabled.
